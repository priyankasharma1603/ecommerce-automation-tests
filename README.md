## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 12 or later) 🌐  
  [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) 💻

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/priyankasharma1603/ecommerce-automation-tests.git
   cd ecommerce-automation-tests
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Cypress Installation:**
   If Cypress is not installed yet, you can install it with:
   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

## ▶️ Running Tests

To open the Cypress Test Runner, use the following command:
```bash
npx cypress open
```
This will launch the Cypress GUI, where you can easily select and run individual tests. 🖱️

To run all tests headlessly (without GUI) in the terminal, use:
```bash
npx cypress run

This command executes all the tests and provides a summary in the console output. 🏃‍♂️

## 🧪 Test Cases

The following test cases have been implemented in this project:

1. **Functional Test:**
   - **Scenario:** Automate a process where a user searches for a product, adds it to the cart, and proceeds to checkout.
   - **Validation:** Ensure the product is correctly added to the cart and validate the checkout process. ✅

2. **Login Test:**
   - **Scenario:** Automate the login process for the e-commerce site.
   - **Validation:** Validate successful login with valid credentials and ensure appropriate error messages are shown for invalid credentials. 🔐

3. **UI Test:**
   - **Scenario:** Verify the presence of key UI elements on the homepage.
   - **Validation:** Ensure that elements such as the search bar, navigation menu, and footer are correctly displayed and functional. 🌟

4. **Form Validation Test:**
   - **Scenario:** Automate a scenario where a user fills out a registration or contact form.
   - **Validation:** Validate required field errors, input constraints, and correct form submission. 📋

## 📊 Reporting

Cypress generates a detailed report of the test results directly in the console after running the tests. For enhanced reporting, consider integrating tools like:
- [Allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) for advanced reports and analytics.
- [Mocha Reports](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) for generating HTML or text reports.

## 🚨 Error Handling

Cypress automatically logs errors and assertions in the console, which helps in debugging failed tests. Ensure to check the console output for any failed tests and their corresponding error messages. This functionality makes it easier to pinpoint issues quickly. 🐞
